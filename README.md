# Condition-C-
This condition allows participants to share their confidence level. 


What I have already done:

The current code allows you to change your confidence level by multiple clicking, thereby changing the color of the objects from sky blue to dark blue.

#####################

What needs to be done: 

We should instruct the code to “communicate” our confidence level to our partner, so that they can see our confidence level on the selected objects. Such that if, for example, the selected object is sky blue, our partner should see it in light red and so forth.
